# Alpha Berkeley Framework


> **🚧 Early Access Release**  
> This is an early access version of the Alpha Berkeley Framework. While the core functionality is stable and ready for experimentation, documentation and APIs may still evolve. We welcome feedback and contributions!

An open-source, domain-agnostic, capability-based architecture for building intelligent agents that can be adapted to any specific domain.

**📄 Research**  
This work was presented as a contributed oral presentation at [ICALEPCS'25](https://indico.jacow.org/event/86/overview) and will be featured at the [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2025/) at NeurIPS 2025.


## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the framework
pip install alpha-berkeley-framework

# Create a new project from a template
framework init my-weather-agent --template hello_world_weather

# Navigate to your project
cd my-weather-agent

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the command line chat interface
framework chat

# Or use the web interface at http://localhost:8080
```
