Current Weather Capability for Hello World Weather Tutorial.

Implements weather data retrieval capability for the Alpha Berkeley Agent Framework,
demonstrating essential capability patterns including LangGraph integration, state
management, error handling, and orchestration guidance. This capability serves as
the primary business logic component for weather information retrieval in the
Hello World Weather tutorial application.

The capability integrates with the framework's execution system through the
@capability_node decorator, providing automatic error handling, retry policies,
streaming support, and state management integration. It demonstrates key patterns
for building production-ready capabilities within the framework ecosystem.

Architecture Integration:
    The capability integrates with multiple framework systems:

    1. **Execution System**: LangGraph node integration via @capability_node decorator
    2. **State Management**: Context storage and retrieval through StateManager utilities
    3. **Streaming System**: Real-time status updates during execution
    4. **Error Handling**: Classification and retry coordination for robust operation
    5. **Orchestration**: Planning guidance for intelligent step sequencing
    6. **Classification**: Task analysis guidance for capability selection

Business Logic:
    The capability implements a complete weather retrieval workflow:

    1. **Location Extraction**: Simple pattern matching from user queries
    2. **Weather Retrieval**: Mock API integration for weather data
    3. **Context Creation**: Structured data packaging in CurrentWeatherContext
    4. **State Storage**: Framework integration via StateManager utilities
    5. **Status Streaming**: Real-time progress updates for user feedback

.. note::
   This capability uses a mock weather service for tutorial purposes.
   Production implementations should integrate with real weather APIs
   like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or similar services.

.. warning::
   Location detection uses simple string matching and supports only
   San Francisco, New York, and Prague. Production implementations
   should use more sophisticated location parsing and broader coverage.

        Analyzes exceptions from weather data retrieval operations and provides
        domain-specific error classification to guide the framework's retry and
        error handling systems. This method implements weather service specific
        error analysis patterns for robust operation in production environments.

        The classification system distinguishes between temporary service issues
        that benefit from retry attempts and permanent errors that require immediate
        attention or alternative handling strategies.

        Error Classification Logic:
            - **Retriable Errors**: Network connectivity and timeout issues that

            - **Critical Errors**: All other exceptions including data parsing errors,
              authentication failures, and programming errors that require immediate attention

        Retry Coordination:
            Classifications integrate with the framework's manual retry system:

            - **RETRIABLE**: Errors are routed through retry coordination with backoff
            - **CRITICAL**: Errors bypass retry system and bubble up for immediate handling

           Error classification should be conservative - when in doubt, classify
           as CRITICAL to avoid infinite retry loops on permanent failures.
           Only classify errors as RETRIABLE when confident they represent
           temporary conditions.

        Examples:
            Network error classification::

        by implementing exponential backoff with reasonable limits.

        The retry policy integrates with the framework's manual retry system to provide
        consistent error recovery behavior across all capabilities while allowing

        """Provide task classification guidance for intelligent capability selection.

        Creates comprehensive guidance for the framework's task classification system
        to understand when user queries require weather data retrieval capabilities.
        This guidance enables accurate capability selection through clear examples
        and reasoning patterns that distinguish weather-related tasks from other queries.

        The guide provides positive and negative examples with detailed reasoning
        to train the classification system's decision-making process, ensuring
        accurate capability activation while avoiding false positives that could
        lead to unnecessary weather service calls.

        Classification Criteria:
            The guide establishes clear patterns for weather capability activation:

            - **Positive Indicators**: Current weather requests, real-time conditions, location-specific queries
            - **Negative Indicators**: Historical weather, forecasts, non-weather information requests
            - **Edge Cases**: Ambiguous queries that require careful analysis
            - **Reasoning Patterns**: Logical frameworks for classification decisions

        Training Examples:
            The guide includes diverse query examples that help the classifier:

            1. **Recognize Patterns**: Learn common weather request formulations
            2. **Distinguish Context**: Differentiate current vs. historical weather
            3. **Handle Ambiguity**: Make reasonable decisions for unclear queries
            4. **Avoid False Positives**: Prevent activation for non-weather tasks

        Integration Benefits:
            Accurate classification enables:

            - **Efficient Execution**: Only activate weather capability when needed
            - **Resource Optimization**: Avoid unnecessary external service calls
            - **User Experience**: Faster responses through precise capability selection
            - **Error Reduction**: Minimize capability mismatches and execution failures

        .. note::
           Classification guidance is used during the task analysis phase before
           execution planning. It helps determine which capabilities should be
           considered for inclusion in the execution workflow.

        .. warning::
           Classification examples should be comprehensive and representative of
           real user queries. Incomplete or biased examples can lead to poor
           classification accuracy and suboptimal capability selection.

        Examples:
            Classifier guidance structure::

                >>> capability = CurrentWeatherCapability()
                >>> guide = capability._create_classifier_guide()
                >>> print(guide.instructions)
                Determine if the task requires current weather information for a specific location.

            Classification example analysis::

                >>> positive_example = guide.examples[0]
                >>> print(f"Query: {positive_example.query}")
                Query: What's the weather like in San Francisco right now?
                >>> print(f"Result: {positive_example.result}")
                Result: True
                >>> print(f"Reason: {positive_example.reason}")
                Reason: Request asks for current weather conditions in a specific location.

            Integration with classification system::

                >>> # Classifier uses guidance to analyze user queries
                >>> query = "How's the weather today?"
