"""Result Type Hierarchy - Execution Tracking and Data Management

This module provides the complete type hierarchy for tracking execution results,
records, and data throughout the ALS Expert framework. The result system enables
comprehensive execution monitoring, error tracking, and state management with
type safety and consistent structure across all framework components.

The result type hierarchy serves multiple critical functions:
1. **Execution Tracking**: Complete records of capability and infrastructure execution
2. **Error Management**: Structured error information with recovery strategies
3. **Data Flow**: Type-safe data passing between capabilities and infrastructure
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Timing and execution metrics for system optimization
5. **State Management**: Consistent result storage and retrieval patterns

Type Hierarchy Structure:
    - **ExecutionResult**: Individual execution outcomes with error handling
    - **ExecutionRecord**: Historical execution records with timing
    - **CapabilityMatch**: Task classification results for capability selection

The result system integrates seamlessly with LangGraph's state management and
checkpointing systems through pure dictionary operations and standard Python
data structures. All result types support JSON serialization for persistence
and inter-process communication.

.. note::
   All result types are designed for LangGraph compatibility with proper
   serialization support and type safety through Pydantic models and dataclasses.

    """Comprehensive result container for capability and infrastructure node executions.
    
    This dataclass provides a complete record of execution outcomes including
    success status, result data, error information, and comprehensive timing
    details. It serves as the primary result container throughout the framework
    for execution tracking, error handling, and performance monitoring.
    
    ExecutionResult enables comprehensive execution analysis by capturing:
    1. **Outcome Status**: Clear success/failure indication
    2. **Result Data**: Actual output from successful executions
    3. **Error Information**: Structured error details for failures
    4. **Timing Metrics**: Performance data for optimization
    5. **Execution Context**: Temporal information for debugging
    
    The result structure supports both synchronous analysis and asynchronous
    processing patterns while maintaining type safety and serialization
    compatibility for persistence and inter-process communication.

    :type success: bool

    :param end_time: UTC timestamp when execution completed

    .. note::
       The success field determines which additional fields are meaningful:
       - Success=True: data should contain results, error should be None
       - Success=False: error should contain details, data should be None
       Timing fields are optional but highly recommended for monitoring.
    
    .. warning::
       Avoid setting both data and error fields simultaneously as this creates
       ambiguous result states. Use success field to determine the authoritative
       execution outcome.

class ExecutionRecord:
    """Comprehensive historical record of completed execution steps.
    
    This dataclass maintains complete records of execution step history including
    the original planned step, comprehensive timing information, and detailed

    tracking, performance analysis, debugging, and audit trails throughout the
    framework.

    4. **Historical Tracking**: Sequential execution records for audit trails
    5. **Debug Information**: Context needed for troubleshooting execution issues
    
    The record structure supports both real-time monitoring and historical

class CapabilityMatch(BaseModel):
    """Task classification result for capability matching and selection.
    
    This Pydantic model represents the outcome of task classification analysis
    to determine whether a user's request should be handled by a specific
    capability. It serves as the primary data structure used by the classification
    system to route requests to appropriate capabilities based on sophisticated
    task analysis and capability matching algorithms.
    
    CapabilityMatch enables intelligent capability selection by providing:
    1. **Binary Classification**: Clear match/no-match decision for routing
    2. **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation ensures data integrity
    3. **Serialization**: JSON-compatible for inter-process communication
    4. **Integration**: Seamless integration with classification pipelines
    5. **Consistency**: Standardized format across all capability matchers
    
    The model is designed for use in classification workflows where multiple
    capabilities are evaluated against a user request, and the classification
    system needs to make routing decisions based on the match results.

       This uses Pydantic BaseModel to ensure type safety, validation, and
       JSON serialization support. The model automatically validates that
       is_match is a proper boolean value.
    
    .. warning::
       The classification system relies on the accuracy of this match result
       for proper capability routing. Ensure classification logic is thoroughly
       tested to avoid routing errors.

        Positive capability match::
        
            match = CapabilityMatch(is_match=True)
