"""Execution Planning Framework - Agent Orchestration and Step Management

This module provides the comprehensive execution planning system for the ALS Expert
framework. It implements TypedDict-based execution planning that enables sophisticated
orchestration, step sequencing, and capability coordination while maintaining full
compatibility with LangGraph's checkpointing and serialization systems.

The planning system serves as the foundation for intelligent agent orchestration
by providing structured representations of execution steps, complete execution
plans, and utility functions for plan management. The TypedDict approach ensures
type safety, JSON serialization compatibility, and seamless integration with
LangGraph's state management and checkpointing systems.

Key Planning System Components:
    1. **PlannedStep**: Individual execution step with objectives and requirements
    2. **ExecutionPlan**: Complete execution sequence with ordered capability steps
    3. **Utility Functions**: Plan persistence, loading, and management operations
    4. **Type Safety**: TypedDict-based definitions for reliable serialization
    5. **LangGraph Integration**: Native compatibility with checkpointing and state

Planning Architecture:
    - **Structured Steps**: Complete step definitions with context and objectives
    - **Parameter Management**: Flexible parameter passing between capabilities
    - **Input/Output Mapping**: Clear data flow specification between steps
    - **Success Criteria**: Explicit success definitions for each execution step
    - **Context Management**: Unique context keys for result storage and retrieval

The planning system emphasizes clarity, type safety, and serialization compatibility
to ensure reliable execution orchestration and effective agent coordination. All
planning structures are designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and modification
throughout the execution lifecycle.

.. note::
   All planning structures use TypedDict with total=False to support partial
   updates in LangGraph state management. This enables incremental plan
   construction and modification during execution.

.. warning::
   Execution plans should maintain referential integrity between steps through
   proper context key management. Avoid circular dependencies in step sequencing.

class PlannedStep(TypedDict, total=False):

    This TypedDict represents a single capability execution within an agent's
    execution plan. It provides complete context including objectives, success
    criteria, input requirements, and expected outputs to enable sophisticated
    orchestration and capability coordination throughout the framework.
    
    PlannedStep serves multiple critical functions:
    1. **Orchestration Guidance**: Clear objectives and success criteria for execution
    2. **Data Flow Management**: Input/output specifications for capability chaining
    3. **Context Management**: Unique keys for result storage and retrieval
    4. **Parameter Passing**: Flexible configuration for capability customization
    5. **Execution Tracking**: Complete context for monitoring and debugging
    
    The structure uses total=False to support partial updates in LangGraph's
    state management system, enabling incremental plan construction and
    modification during execution. All fields are optional to provide
    flexibility in plan creation and evolution.
    
    Field Definitions:
        - context_key: Unique identifier for storing step results in execution context
        - capability: Name of the capability to execute for this step
        - task_objective: Complete, self-sufficient description of step goals
        - success_criteria: Clear criteria for determining successful completion
        - expected_output: Context type key where results will be stored
        - parameters: Optional capability-specific configuration parameters
        - inputs: Step inputs as list of {context_type: context_key} mappings
    
    Default behaviors (when fields not provided):
        - expected_output: None (no specific output context expected)
        - parameters: None (no custom parameters required)
        - inputs: [] (no input dependencies)
    
    .. note::
       The task_objective should be complete and self-sufficient to enable
       capability execution without additional context. Success_criteria should
       be specific and measurable for reliable execution validation.
    
    .. warning::
       Context keys must be unique within an execution plan to prevent
       result collisions. Use descriptive, namespaced keys for clarity.
    
    Examples:
        Data retrieval step::
        
            step = PlannedStep(
                context_key="weather_data",
                capability="weather_retrieval",

                success_criteria="Weather data retrieved with temperature and conditions",
                expected_output="WEATHER_DATA",
                parameters={"location": "San Francisco", "units": "metric"}

        Data processing step with dependencies::
        
            step = PlannedStep(
                context_key="processed_data",
                capability="data_processor",

class ExecutionPlan(TypedDict, total=False):
    """Complete execution plan with ordered capability sequence and orchestration context.
    
    This TypedDict represents the orchestrator's comprehensive plan for accomplishing
    a user's request through a coordinated sequence of capability executions. It
    provides the complete execution roadmap including step ordering, data flow,
    and coordination requirements for complex multi-capability tasks.
    
    ExecutionPlan serves as the primary coordination mechanism for:
    1. **Multi-Step Execution**: Ordered sequence of capability invocations
    2. **Data Flow Management**: Input/output coordination between capabilities
    3. **State Persistence**: LangGraph-compatible structure for checkpointing
    4. **Execution Tracking**: Foundation for monitoring and debugging
    5. **Plan Evolution**: Support for dynamic plan modification during execution
    
    The structure uses total=False to support incremental plan construction
    and modification in LangGraph's state management system. This enables
    dynamic planning where plans can be built progressively and modified
    based on execution results and changing requirements.
    
    Plan Structure:
        - steps: Ordered list of PlannedStep objects defining the execution sequence
    
    Default behaviors (when fields not provided):
        - steps: [] (empty plan requiring population)
    
    .. note::
       ExecutionPlan uses pure dictionary format for maximum compatibility with
       LangGraph's serialization and checkpointing systems. All plan data can
       be safely persisted and restored across execution sessions.
    
    .. warning::
       Step ordering is critical for proper execution flow. Ensure dependencies
       between steps are properly sequenced and context keys are unique to
       prevent execution conflicts.
