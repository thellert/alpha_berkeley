"""Framework Approval System for Production-Ready Approval Workflows.

This module provides the core LangGraph-native approval system that integrates
with the production Gateway architecture for clean, secure approval handling.
The system enables structured interrupts for human approval of operations
requiring oversight, with comprehensive validation and error handling.

Key Components:
    - Dynamic approval type generation for flexible capability integration
    - Structured interrupt data creation for LangGraph compatibility
    - State management utilities for approval workflow handling
    - Service integration helpers for consistent interrupt propagation

The approval system supports multiple operation types including execution plans,
code execution, and memory operations, with extensible architecture for adding
new approval types without framework modifications.

Examples:
    Create approval for code execution::
    
        >>> interrupt_data = create_code_approval_interrupt(
        ...     code="print('Hello, World!')",
        ...     analysis_details={'safety_level': 'low'},
        ...     execution_mode='readonly',
        ...     safety_concerns=[]
        ... )
        >>> # Use interrupt_data with LangGraph interrupt() function
        
    Handle approval resume::
    
        >>> has_resume, payload = get_approval_resume_data(state, "python_executor")
        >>> if has_resume and payload:
        ...     code = payload['code']
        ...     # Execute approved code
        
.. note::
   This module is designed for security-critical operations. All approval
   functions include comprehensive validation and error handling.

    across capabilities while maintaining proper error handling.
    
    The function catches GraphInterrupts from subgraph services, extracts
    the interrupt data, and re-raises them in the main graph context.
    Non-interrupt exceptions are re-raised unchanged for normal error handling.
    
    :param service: Service instance to invoke (must support ainvoke method)
    :type service: Any
    :param request: Request object to send to the service
    :type request: Any
    :param config: Configuration dictionary for service invocation
    :type config: Dict[str, Any]
    :param logger: Logger instance for operation tracking and debugging
    :type logger: logging.Logger
    :param capability_name: Name of calling capability for logging context
    :type capability_name: str
    :return: Service result if execution completes normally
    :rtype: Any
    :raises RuntimeError: If interrupt handling fails or interrupt mechanism fails
    :raises Exception: Re-raises any non-GraphInterrupt exceptions unchanged
    
    Examples:
        Handle service with potential interrupts::
        
            >>> import logging
            >>> logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            >>> try:
            ...     result = await handle_service_with_interrupts(
            ...         service=python_executor_service,
            ...         request={'code': 'print("hello")', 'mode': 'readonly'},
            ...         config={'timeout': 30},
            ...         logger=logger,
            ...         capability_name='data_analysis'
            ...     )
            ...     print(f"Service completed: {result}")
            ... except RuntimeError as e:
            ...     print(f"Service handling failed: {e}")
    
    .. warning::
       This function expects GraphInterrupts to follow LangGraph's standard
       structure. Malformed interrupts will cause RuntimeError to be raised.
    
    .. note::
       The interrupt() call should pause execution - if it returns normally,
       a RuntimeError is raised as this indicates a system malfunction.
