"""
Core User Memory Provider - Framework Data Source Integration

Provides seamless integration of user memory storage into the framework's data source
management system. This module implements the UserMemoryProvider class which serves as
a core data source that's always available for memory context injection.

The provider automatically retrieves stored user memories and formats them for inclusion
in LLM prompts, enabling conversation continuity and personalized interactions across
sessions. It integrates with the memory storage manager for persistent data access and
follows the framework's data source provider patterns for consistent behavior.

Key Features:
    - Core data source provider integration for universal memory access
    - Automatic memory retrieval and LLM prompt formatting
    - High-priority context injection for enhanced user experience
    - Seamless integration with the framework's data source management system
    - Health checking and configuration requirements management

.. note::
   This provider is registered as a core framework data source and is always
   available when a user ID is present in the session configuration unless
   overridden or excluded by an application registry.

    backend and the framework's data source architecture.
    
    This provider implements sophisticated memory retrieval and formatting capabilities,
    automatically converting stored memory entries into structured context data that
