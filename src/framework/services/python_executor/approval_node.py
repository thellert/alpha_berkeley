"""Approval Node for Python Executor Service - LangGraph Integration.

This module implements the approval workflow node within the Python executor service's
LangGraph-based architecture. It provides a clean, focused implementation that handles
user approval interrupts for Python code execution without duplicating approval logic.

The approval node follows a specialized design pattern where it serves as a pure
interrupt handler, delegating all approval decision logic to the analyzer node to
maintain clean separation of concerns and avoid execution duplication.

Key Design Principles:
    - **Single Responsibility**: Only handles LangGraph interrupt processing
    - **Clean Separation**: Approval logic resides in analyzer node, not here
    - **Interrupt-Focused**: Leverages LangGraph's native interrupt system
    - **Minimal State**: Processes pre-created interrupt data without modification
    - **Simple Routing**: Provides basic approval result processing for workflow routing

The node integrates seamlessly with the broader approval system while maintaining
the clean architecture principles of the Python executor service.

.. note::
   This node expects approval interrupt data to be pre-created by the analyzer node.
   It does not perform approval decision logic or create interrupt data.

.. warning::
   This node will raise a RuntimeError if called without proper interrupt data
   being set up by the analyzer node.

   :class:`framework.approval.ApprovalManager` : Framework-level approval management
   :func:`langgraph.types.interrupt` : LangGraph interrupt mechanism

Examples:
    The approval node is typically used within the service graph::
    
        >>> # This is handled automatically by the service
        >>> workflow.add_node("python_approval_node", create_approval_node())
        >>> workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        ...     "python_code_analyzer",
        ...     analyzer_conditional_edge,
        ...     {"approve": "python_approval_node", ...}
        ... )
        
    The node processes interrupt data created by the analyzer::
    
        >>> # Analyzer creates interrupt data
        >>> interrupt_data = create_code_approval_interrupt(
        ...     code=generated_code,
        ...     analysis_details=analysis_result,
        ...     safety_concerns=["File system access detected"]
        ... )
        >>> # Approval node processes the interrupt
        >>> human_response = interrupt(interrupt_data)  # LangGraph handles this
