"""Framework State - Execution State Management.

This module provides comprehensive execution state management for the Alpha Berkeley
Agent Framework, including approval workflows, planning state, execution tracking,
and control flow management. The execution state system supports the complete
execution lifecycle from planning through completion.

**Core Components:**

- :class:`ApprovalRequest`: Approval workflow management for sensitive operations
- :class:`PlanningState`: Planning and orchestration state management
- :class:`ExecutionState`: Execution progress and result tracking
- :class:`ControlFlowState`: Control flow and retry logic management
- :class:`ClassificationResult`: Task classification and graph building results

**Execution Lifecycle:**

The execution state system manages the complete execution lifecycle:

1. **Classification**: Task analysis and capability selection
2. **Planning**: Execution plan creation and step definition
3. **Execution**: Step-by-step execution with result tracking
4. **Approval**: Human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive operations
5. **Control Flow**: Retry logic, error handling, and execution limits

**State Architecture:**

All state classes use TypedDict with total=False to support LangGraph's partial
state update patterns. The execution state integrates with the main AgentState
to provide comprehensive execution tracking and control.

**Approval System:**

The approval system provides human-in-the-loop control for sensitive operations:
- Python code execution approval
- Memory operation approval  
- EPICS write operation approval
- Custom capability-specific approvals

.. note::
   All execution state classes support partial updates for LangGraph compatibility.
   Default values are documented in each class and applied by StateManager.

@dataclass
class ApprovalRequest:
    """Comprehensive approval request data structure for human-in-the-loop workflows.
    
    This dataclass represents a complete approval request that tracks all necessary
    context for human decision-making in sensitive operations. The approval system
    uses these requests to manage pending approvals, track approval decisions, and
    provide audit trails for security-sensitive operations.
    
    **Approval Workflow:**
    
    1. **Request Creation**: Created when a capability encounters an approval requirement
    2. **Context Capture**: Records step context, capability, and operation details
    3. **Human Review**: Presented to users through UI for approval decision
    4. **Decision Tracking**: Records approval/rejection with timestamp
    5. **Execution Control**: Controls whether operation proceeds or is blocked
    
    **Security Integration:**
    
    ApprovalRequest integrates with the framework's security model to provide
    controlled access to sensitive operations including:
    
    - Python code execution with potential system access
    - Memory operations that could store sensitive information
    - EPICS write operations that could affect accelerator systems
    - Custom capability-specific sensitive operations
    
    :param step_objective: Human-readable description of the step requiring approval
    :type step_objective: str
    :param capability: Name of the capability requesting approval for identification
    :type capability: str
    :param approval_type: Type of approval required for categorization and handling
    :type approval_type: str
    :param timestamp: Unix timestamp when the approval request was created
    :type timestamp: float
    :param approved: Current approval status of the request
    :type approved: bool
    :param approval_data: Original approval exception or additional context data
    :type approval_data: Optional[Any]
    
    .. note::
       The approval_data field can contain the original approval exception or
       additional context needed for the approval decision. This enables
       capability-specific approval handling and rich context presentation.
    
    .. warning::
       ApprovalRequest instances should be treated as immutable once created,
       except for the approved field which is updated when decisions are made.
       This ensures audit trail integrity.
    
    Examples:
        Python code execution approval::
        
            >>> import time
            >>> request = ApprovalRequest(
            ...     step_objective="Execute data analysis script",

            ...     approval_type="python_code_execution",
            ...     timestamp=time.time(),
            ...     approved=False
            ... )
            >>> request.is_pending
            True
        
        Memory operation approval::
        
            >>> request = ApprovalRequest(
            ...     step_objective="Save user preferences",
            ...     capability="memory_manager",

            ...     approval_data={"memory_type": "user_preferences"}
            ... )
        
        Approval decision handling::
