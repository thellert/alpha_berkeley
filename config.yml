# ============================================================
# Service Deployment Control (Override Layer)
# ============================================================
# This section overrides the deployed_services from framework and application configs.
# It provides a convenient single place to control which containers are started when you run:
# python deployment/container_manager.py config.yml up
#
# IMPORTANT: This does not disable functionality - it only controls which
# containers get started. Services not listed here simply won't have their
# containers launched, but their configurations remain available.
#
# Each imported config (framework, applications) has its own deployed_services section,
# but this main config acts as the final override for convenience.
#
# You can use either full service keys (framework.jupyter) or short names (jupyter).
# Full keys are recommended for clarity about what you're starting.

deployed_services:
  # Framework services (essential for framework operation, see also src/framework/config.yml)
  - framework.jupyter          # Python execution environment with EPICS support
  - framework.open_webui       # Primary user interface frontend  
  - framework.pipelines        # Processing pipeline infrastructure
  # - framework.langfuse         # Observability and tracing infrastructure
  
  # ALS Expert application services (domain-specific) - MOVED HERE FROM src/applications/als_expert/config.yml as CONVENIENCE
  # - applications.als_expert.mongo        # Primary database for ALS Expert data
  # - applications.als_expert.neo4j        # Graph database for relationship mapping
  # - applications.als_expert.qdrant       # Vector database for semantic search
  # - applications.als_expert.logbook      # ALS electronic logbook integration
  # - applications.als_expert.pv_finder    # Process Variable discovery for EPICS
  

# Development Configuration

  # If true, exceptions will be raised directly instead of being wrapped in ExecutionError

  # Prompt debugging configuration
  prompts:
    # If true, prints all system prompts to console when they are built
    # Useful for debugging prompt generation and seeing what's being sent to LLMs
    show_all: false
    
    # If true, saves all system prompts to files for inspection
    # Prompts are saved to the prompts_dir specified in agent configuration
    print_all: true
    
    # If true, only keeps the latest version of each prompt file
    # If false, saves prompts with timestamps to track changes over time

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  # Rich logging traceback settings
  rich_tracebacks: false              # Enable/disable rich-formatted tracebacks
  show_traceback_locals: false       # Show local variables in tracebacks
