   **Enterprise-Grade Production Architecture:**
   
   - LangGraph-native approval workflows with configurable security policies
   - Multi-source data integration through provider framework patterns  
   - Container-isolated Python execution with security analysis and EPICS integration
   - Persistent memory storage with cross-session context preservation
   - Complete container management and service orchestration for scalable deployment

   **Prerequisites:** Solid understanding of Infrastructure Components and production deployment concepts
   
   **Target Audience:** DevOps engineers, system administrators, and architects deploying agentic systems in production environments

The Alpha Berkeley Framework offers enterprise-grade infrastructure components designed for secure and scalable deployment of agentic systems. These production-ready systems ensure human oversight, data integration, secure execution, and orchestration capabilities essential for high-stakes environments. By implementing a Security-First, Approval-Centric Architecture, the framework delivers robust capabilities while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse deployment scenarios.

Production Integration Patterns
===============================

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Orchestrator Approval

      High-level execution plan approval with planning mode integration:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Planning mode enables strategic oversight
         user_input = "/planning Analyze beam performance and adjust parameters"
         
         # Orchestrator creates complete execution plan
         execution_plan = await create_execution_plan(
             task=current_task,
             capabilities=active_capabilities
         )
         
         # Human approval of entire plan before execution
         interrupt_data = create_plan_approval_interrupt(
             execution_plan=execution_plan,
             step_objective=current_task
         )
         interrupt(interrupt_data)  # LangGraph native interrupt

      - **Strategic plan oversight** before capability execution begins
      - **Multi-capability coordination** with human validation
      - **LangGraph-native interrupts** with resumable workflow
      - **Complete context** including capability dependencies and flow

   .. tab-item:: Python Execution

      Code-specific approval with EPICS analysis and container isolation:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Security analysis determines approval requirements
         analyzer = StaticCodeAnalyzer(configurable)
         analysis = await analyzer.analyze_code(generated_code, context)
         
         # Domain-specific approval policies
         approval_evaluator = get_python_execution_evaluator()
         decision = approval_evaluator.evaluate(
             has_epics_writes=analysis.has_epics_writes,
             has_epics_reads=analysis.has_epics_reads
         )
         
         if decision.needs_approval:
             approval_result = await create_code_approval_interrupt(
                 code=generated_code,
                 analysis_details=analysis,
                 execution_mode=execution_mode
             )
         
         # Container-isolated execution
         result = await execute_python_code_in_container(
             code=code,
             endpoint=container_endpoint,
             execution_folder=execution_folder
         )

      - **Code-level security analysis** with EPICS operation detection
      - **Configurable approval modes** (disabled, epics_writes, all_code)
      - **Container isolation** for secure execution environments
      - **Domain-specific policies** for accelerator control systems

   .. tab-item:: Data Integration

      Unified data access through the provider framework:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Parallel data retrieval pattern
         data_context = await data_manager.retrieve_all_context(
             DataSourceRequest(query=task.description)
         )
         
         # Available to all capabilities automatically
         user_memory = data_context.get("core_user_memory")
         domain_data = data_context.get("custom_provider")

      - **Automatic provider discovery** through registry system
      - **Parallel retrieval** with timeout management
      - **Type-safe integration** with capability context

   .. tab-item:: Service Orchestration

      Coordinated deployment and management of production services:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Container management using the function-based system
         from deployment.container_manager import find_service_config, setup_build_dir
         
         # Deploy services by configuring them in deployed_services list
         deployed_services = [
             "framework.pipelines",
             "framework.jupyter", 
             "framework.langfuse"
         ]
         
         # Services are deployed through container_manager.py script
         # python container_manager.py config.yml up -d
         
         # Service management through compose files
         for service_name in deployed_services:
             service_config, template_path = find_service_config(config, service_name)
             if service_config and template_path:
                 compose_file = setup_build_dir(template_path, config, service_config)

      - **Hierarchical service discovery** through framework.* and applications.* naming
      - **Template-based configuration** for environment-specific deployments  
      - **Podman Compose orchestration** with multi-file support

   .. tab-item:: Memory Integration

      Persistent user context with intelligent retrieval:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Memory-enhanced capability execution  
         @capability_node
         class DataAnalysisCapability(BaseCapability):
             async def execute(state: AgentState, **kwargs):
                 # Retrieve user memory through data source integration
                 data_manager = get_data_source_manager()
                 requester = DataSourceRequester("capability", "data_analysis")
                 request = create_data_source_request(state, requester)
                 retrieval_result = await data_manager.retrieve_all_context(request)
                 
                 # Access memory context from data sources
                 user_memory_context = retrieval_result.context_data.get("core_user_memory")
                 if user_memory_context:
                     user_memories = user_memory_context.data  # UserMemories object
                     # Use memory data to enhance analysis

      - **Data source integration** for automatic memory context injection
      - **Persistent memory storage** through UserMemoryProvider
      - **Framework-native memory operations** through MemoryOperationsCapability
