The Alpha Berkeley Framework is a production-ready conversational agentic system built on LangGraph's StateGraph foundation. Its distinctive architecture centers on **Classification and Orchestration** - capability selection followed by upfront execution planning - providing reliable, scalable multi-step operations with human oversight that scales well to a large number of domain specific tools.

Framework Architecture Overview
===============================

The framework processes every conversation through a structured pipeline that transforms natural language into reliable, orchestrated execution plans:

**1. Unified Entry Point**
   All user interactions flow through a single Gateway that normalizes input from CLI, web interfaces, and external integrations.

**2. Comprehensive Task Extraction**
   Transforms arbitrarily long chat history and external data sources into a well-defined current task with actionable requirements and context.

**3. Task Classification System**
   LLM-powered classification for each capability ensures only relevant prompts are used in downstream processes, providing efficient prompt management.

**4. Upfront Orchestration**
   Complete execution plans are generated before any capability execution begins, preventing hallucination and ensuring reliable outcomes.

**5. Controlled Execution**
   Plans execute step-by-step with checkpoints, human approval workflows, and comprehensive error handling.

Framework Functions
===================

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Task Processing

      Converts conversational input into structured, actionable tasks:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Chat history becomes focused task
         current_task = await _extract_task(
             messages=state["messages"],
             retrieval_result=data_manager.retrieve_all_context(request),
         )

                 
      - **Context Compression**: Refines lengthy conversations into precise, actionable tasks
      - **Datasource Integration**: Enhances tasks with structured data from external sources
      - **Self-Contained Output**: Produces tasks that are executable without relying on prior conversation history

   .. tab-item:: Capability Selection

      Task classification determines which capabilities are relevant:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Each capability gets yes/no decision
         active_capabilities = await classify_task(
             task=state.current_task,
             available_capabilities=registry.get_all_capabilities()
         )

      - **Binary Decisions**: Yes/no for each capability
      - **Prompt Efficiency**: Only relevant capabilities loaded
      - **Parallel Processing**: Independent classification decisions

   .. tab-item:: Capability Orchestration

      Creates complete execution plans before any capability runs:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Generate validated execution plan
         execution_plan = await create_execution_plan(
             task=state.current_task,
             capabilities=state.active_capabilities
         )

      - **Upfront Planning**: Complete plans before execution
      - **Plan Validation**: Prevents capability hallucination
      - **Deterministic Execution**: Router follows predetermined steps

   .. tab-item:: State Management

      Manages conversation context and execution state:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Persistent context across conversations
         StateManager.store_context(
             state, "PV_ADDRESSES", context_key, pv_data
         )

      - **Conversation Persistence**: Context survives restarts
      - **Execution Tracking**: Current step and progress
      - **Context Isolation**: Capability-specific data storage

   .. tab-item:: Approval Workflows

      Human oversight through LangGraph interrupts:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Request human approval
         if requires_approval:
             interrupt(approval_data)
             # Execution pauses for human decision

      - **Planning Approval**: Review execution plans before running
      - **Code Approval**: Human review of generated code
      - **Native Integration**: Built on LangGraph interrupts
