   **Advanced Framework Internals:**
   
   - LangGraph-native state management with selective persistence strategies
   - Pydantic-based context objects with intelligent caching and serialization
   - Convention-based registry patterns with lazy loading and component discovery
   - Domain-specific prompt builders with dependency injection patterns
   - Complete message processing pipeline from Gateway entry to response generation
   - Three-tier YAML configuration with hierarchical merging and override patterns

   **Prerequisites:** Completion of Quick Start Patterns and understanding of LangGraph concepts
   
   **Target Audience:** Framework developers and advanced capability authors building sophisticated agentic systems

Master the sophisticated internal systems that enable reliable, type-safe agent development. These core systems provide the foundation for building production-ready conversational agents with proper state management, data sharing, and component orchestration.

System Architecture
===================

The Core Framework Systems implement a **LangGraph-Native, Type-Safe Architecture** with five interconnected components:

System Integration
==================

These systems work together to provide a cohesive development experience:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Data Flow

      How information moves through the framework:

      .. code-block:: python

         # State provides the foundation
         state = StateManager.create_fresh_state(user_input)
         
         # Context enables data sharing
         context = ContextManager(state)
         pv_data = context.get_context('PV_ADDRESSES', 'beam_current')
         
         # Registry provides component access
         registry = get_registry()
         capability = registry.get_capability('pv_value_retrieval')
         
         # Message flow coordinates execution
         result = await capability.execute(state)

   .. tab-item:: Performance Strategy

      Optimization through intelligent design:

      .. code-block:: python

         # State: Only context persists across conversations
         capability_context_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]]  # Persists
         execution_step_results: Dict[str, Any]                        # Resets
         
         # Context: Object caching and efficient serialization
         context = ContextManager(state)  # Cached object reconstruction
         
         # Registry: Lazy loading and singleton patterns
         initialize_registry()  # One-time component discovery
         registry = get_registry()  # Singleton access

   .. tab-item:: Development Patterns

      Common implementation patterns:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Capability with all systems integration
         @capability_node  # Registry registration
         class MyCapability(BaseCapability):
             @staticmethod
             async def execute(state: AgentState, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
                 # Context access
                 context = ContextManager(state)
                 data = context.get_context('INPUT_DATA', 'key')
                 
                 # Processing logic
                 result = process_data(data)
                 
                 # Context storage
                 output = OutputData(results=result)
                 return StateManager.store_context(
                     state, 'OUTPUT_DATA', 'processed', output
                 )
