   **Gateway-First Processing Architecture:**
   
   - Gateway-driven message processing with universal entry point patterns
   - Task extraction system converting conversations into actionable requirements
   - LLM-powered classification and intelligent routing for capability selection
   - Orchestrator-first planning with upfront execution plan generation
   - Adaptive response generation and sophisticated error handling with recovery

   **Prerequisites:** Understanding of Core Framework Systems and LangGraph StateGraph concepts
   
   **Target Audience:** Infrastructure developers and agentic system architects building reliable, controllable execution pipelines

The Infrastructure Components provide the intelligent processing core that makes sophisticated agentic behavior possible while maintaining the reliability and oversight required for production systems. Master these components, and you'll understand how to build agents that combine LLM intelligence with predictable, controllable execution.

Architecture Overview
=====================

The Alpha Berkeley Framework implements a **Gateway-First, Three-Pillar Architecture** that eliminates the fragility and inefficiency of traditional reactive agentic systems:

**Traditional Approach:**

.. code-block:: text

   User Query â†’ Tool Call 1 â†’ Analyze â†’ Tool Call 2 â†’ Analyze â†’ Tool Call 3 â†’ Response

**Orchestrator-First Approach:**

.. code-block:: text

   User Query â†’ Complete Plan Creation â†’ Execute All Steps â†’ Response

**Benefits:** Single planning phase, full context utilization, natural human oversight, more efficient LLM usage.
