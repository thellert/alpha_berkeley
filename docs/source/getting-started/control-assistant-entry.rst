Production Control Systems Tutorial
===================================

This tutorial demonstrates **production-grade patterns for control system integration** through an accelerator physics application based on the deployed :doc:`ALS Accelerator Assistant <../example-applications/als-assistant>`. Unlike the Hello World tutorial's simple mock API and workflow, you'll work with scalable patterns for scientific facility integration. The tutorial provides **two alternative semantic channel finding implementations**—in-context search and hierarchical navigation—allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your facility's needs. You'll implement a service layer architecture with supporting tools including a standalone CLI, database utilities, and benchmark runners.

What You'll Build
=================

An accelerator control system assistant that finds control system addresses (like EPICS PVs) using natural language queries. This demonstrates the core challenge in any large control system: **translating human intent to specific hardware addresses**.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Example Queries

      .. code-block:: text

         "What is the current beam current?"
         → Retrieves live value from the control system

         "Plot the beam current over the last 24 hours"
         → Demonstrates archiver access and data visualization

         "Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the beam current in the last 24 hours"
         → Performs statistical analysis on historical data

   .. tab-item:: The Challenge

      Control systems at scientific facilities have naming challenges:

      - **Scale**: few hundred to hundreds of thousands of addressable channels
      - **Inconsistent Naming**: Legacy systems, evolving conventions
      - **Domain Knowledge**: Requires subsystem expertise
      - **Critical Impact**: Wrong channel = equipment damage
      - **Safe Execution**: Requires secure Python execution for data analysis

      Natural language channel finding solves this by letting operators describe what they want instead of memorizing cryptic addresses.

   .. tab-item:: Real-World Context

      At large accelerator facilities like the Advanced Light Source:

      - **Hundreds of thousands of channels** across all subsystems
      - **Distributed expertise** across physics, RF, magnets, vacuum, controls
      - **Complex operations** requiring rapid diagnosis and response
      - **Safety-critical** decisions based on correct channel identification

      This tutorial's patterns scale from small control systems :doc:`to facilities of this scale and complexity <../example-applications/als-assistant>`.
