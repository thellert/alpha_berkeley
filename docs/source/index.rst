What is Alpha Berkeley Framework?
----------------------------------

The **Alpha Berkeley Framework** provides a production-ready architecture for building domain-specific agentic systems. Built on :doc:`LangGraph's StateGraph foundation <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/03_langgraph-integration>`, it implements a structured pipeline that transforms natural language inputs into reliable, orchestrated execution plans.

The framework addresses common challenges in agentic system development: :doc:`tool management at scale <developer-guides/03_core-framework-systems/03_registry-and-discovery>`, :doc:`structured orchestration without hallucination <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/04_orchestrator-first-philosophy>`, and seamless integration of :doc:`human oversight workflows <api_reference/03_production_systems/01_human-approval>`.

   The framework architecture illustrates the process flow from natural language input to orchestrated execution, encompassing: **Task Extraction** ‚Üí **Classification** ‚Üí **Orchestration** ‚Üí **Execution**.

The framework provides:

* **Capability-Based Architecture**: :doc:`Modular agent construction <developer-guides/02_quick-start-patterns/01_building-your-first-capability>` with selective capability activation based on task requirements
* **Orchestrator-First Design**: :doc:`Complete execution planning <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/04_orchestrator-planning>` prior to capability invocation, eliminating iterative tool-calling patterns
* **Secure Python Execution**: :doc:`Containerized code generation and execution <developer-guides/05_production-systems/03_python-execution-service>` with static analysis, human approval, and flexible deployment environments
* **Registry-Based Discovery**: :doc:`Convention-driven component loading <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/02_convention-over-configuration>` enables seamless integration of capabilities, data sources, and services across applications
* **LangGraph Integration**: Native StateGraph workflows with :doc:`checkpoints, interrupts <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/03_langgraph-integration>`, and :doc:`persistent state management <developer-guides/03_core-framework-systems/01_state-management-architecture>`
* **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: :ref:`Transparent execution plans <planning-mode-example>` with :doc:`approval workflows <developer-guides/05_production-systems/01_human-approval-workflows>` for high-stakes operational environments
* **Domain Abstraction**: Framework patterns applicable across diverse infrastructure, from :doc:`simple agents <getting-started/hello-world-tutorial>` to complex :doc:`multi-capability systems <getting-started/build-your-first-agent>`
