Production Integration
======================

These systems work together to provide comprehensive production capabilities:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Security Flow

      How safety and oversight are maintained:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Approval system integration
         from framework.approval import get_approval_manager
         approval_manager = get_approval_manager()
         
         # Secure execution with oversight
         from framework.services.python_executor import PythonExecutorService, PythonExecutionRequest
         python_service = PythonExecutorService()
         request = PythonExecutionRequest(
             user_query="Analyze beam performance data",
             task_objective="Generate comprehensive performance report"
         )
         
         # Service automatically pauses for human review when requires_approval: true
         config = {"thread_id": "session_123"}
         result = await python_service.ainvoke(request, config)
         # Execution resumes after approval with audit trail

   .. tab-item:: Data Architecture

      Unified data access across systems:

      .. code-block:: python

         # Data source integration
         from framework.data_management import (
             get_data_source_manager, 
             create_data_source_request, 
             DataSourceRequester
         )
         data_manager = get_data_source_manager()
         request = create_data_source_request(
             state, 
             requester=DataSourceRequester(
                 capability_name="performance_analysis",
                 component_name="beam_analysis"
             ),
             query="beam current trends"
         )
         
         # Concurrent retrieval from all providers
         result = await data_manager.retrieve_all_context(request)
         
         # Memory integration
         from framework.services.memory_storage import get_memory_storage_manager, MemoryContent
         from datetime import datetime
         memory_manager = get_memory_storage_manager()
         memory_entry = MemoryContent(
             timestamp=datetime.now(),
             content=f"Analysis results: {result.context_data}"
         )
         success = memory_manager.add_memory_entry(user_id, memory_entry)

   .. tab-item:: Deployment Strategy

      Container orchestration for scalability:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         # Container deployment configuration
         deployed_services:
           - framework.jupyter              # Secure execution environment
           - framework.pipelines            # Processing pipeline infrastructure
           - applications.als_expert.logbook  # Application data

         framework:
           execution:
             execution_method: "container"   # Isolation by default
             modes:
               write_access:
                 requires_approval: true    # Safety first
                 allows_writes: true
                 kernel_name: "python3-epics-write"
