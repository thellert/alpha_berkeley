### Value Proposition Section

**Problem-Solution Narrative:**
```markdown
## Traditional Agent Frameworks vs. Alpha Berkeley

| Traditional Approach | Alpha Berkeley Framework |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Multiple LLM calls per task | Single upfront planning call |
| Complex agent loops | Direct tool chaining |
| Manual wiring required | Convention-based auto-discovery |
| Framework-specific APIs | Standard JSON CRUD + JWT |
| Difficult to debug | Transparent execution plans |
```

**Unique Value Propositions:**
1. **Orchestrator-First Architecture**: Single LLM planning call vs. multiple tool calls
2. **Convention Over Configuration**: `@capability_node` auto-discovery patterns
3. **Production-Ready**: Human-in-the-loop approval workflows built-in
4. **Framework Agnostic**: Standard APIs instead of vendor lock-in
5. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with LangGraph integration

### Navigation Strategy
